# IVID styles

IVID uses a separate [stylesheet](../src/style.css) written in plain CSS. You can copy and customize it as you please.

These styles are optional and independant of IVID's functionalities, and apply to the video display layout, player controls and choice chooser menu.

Although there're not mandatory to use, they'll surely provide you with a much nicer visual experience.
